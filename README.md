## 🧠 Why I Built This 🧠

This mini project started as a simple challenge: build a single profile card that looks clean, feels interactive, and supports dark mode. I wanted to push beyond basic styling and explore how small UI details—like bounce animations and glow effects—can make a component feel alive.

The goal wasn’t to create a full webpage, but to craft a standalone, reusable card that could live anywhere: in a portfolio, a dashboard, or even as a design snippet. Of course, the toggle slider can be placed anywhere on a webpage 😎. I kept the JavaScript minimal, focusing instead on CSS transitions, keyframes, and custom properties to handle theme switching and animations.

This project helped me:
- Practice combining multiple animations without conflict
- Use CSS variables for theme control
- Build a toggle switch with smooth feedback
- Keep the layout responsive and accessible

It’s a small piece, but it reflects my approach to frontend: thoughtful, animated, and always learning by doing 👨‍🔧.
